# SupTG Image Tools
A userscript to provide a different image experience on SupTG, an archive of threads from 4chan's /tg/ board.

SupTG Image Tools expands all images on SupTG archive threads by default, and changes the functionality of clicking an image to toggle between thumbnails and full size (clicking the file name still links directly to the full size image).

**SupTG Image Tools is not associated with the fine folks at http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/, and is simply meant to provide a slightly different experience to those wanting it.**

## Installing

Install a userscript add-on for your browser, such as [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net), and follow your add-on's instructions for installing userscripts to add [suptgImageTools.user.js](https://github.com/faokryn/suptg-image-tools/blob/master/suptgImageTools.user.js).
